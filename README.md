# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  -->For one to ensure that their code, program or software is functional and secure, one must test their code. In this case, both functional and non-functional test must be conducted. Functional testing include the followings: Unit testing, Component testing, Regression testing, Integration testing, API testing, UI testing, System testing, Acceptance testing and Production testing. Non functional testing means testing not involving the use of codes. It can be visual and logical code errors.
  
  
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs must be noted. Ask the users questions regarding their needs and the purpose that they will served then evaluate their request for feasibility becuase not every time that their request will be possible. Once evaluated to be possible, then their needs must be broken in to small components which can be integrated piece by piece in the code to study the interaction of the systems with the new features.

# How do I approach designing software?
There are two main approaches to software design, namely, Function-Oriented Approach and Object-Oriented Approach. Object-oriented software design focus on data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. It focus on the processing of data or object.  Function-oriented design focuson a set of decomposed interacting units where each unit has a clearly defined function.
